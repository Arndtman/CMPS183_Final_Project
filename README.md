# CMPS183_Final_Project - Alex Branch

This is my branch for the final project. 

I align my tasks into each folder on this branch. 

Since I had to pack the site, I also uploaded the independent files I modified. 


GrubMeet

Want to make friends in Santa Cruz? Sign up for our service, have a meal with strangers, make new friends!
The goal of this project is to bring people together with a meal by using an easy to use service.

How it works:
Create an account on our website
Host a meal by creating an appointment on the calendar
Or join an existing meal by signing up for it
Go to the meal and enjoy the company of strangers!
